# React serverless-side-rendering on Cloud Run

React SSR can be a pain if you don't want to run Next or another ready-made solution. This repo tries to solve that.

This repo gives you a minimal-ish React setup with Typescript configured to be bundled with Docker for a server-side container, and with files (those outside the `src` folder) ready to build a client-side bundle. There's a bit of scripting to help you set up a minimal Cloud Run app, and with an option to bring in a fuller CI/CD solution on Google Cloud Platform.

There is nothing magic about the container or core source part of thisâ€”feel free to use it in Fargate, Azure Container Instances or wherever you like!

**Note**: There is currently no typical Webpack "dev" support, you should add this configuration on your own, as/if needed.

## Prerequisites

The below is primarily relevant if you want to deploy this on Cloud Run. Else, you would probably only need Docker.

- You have a Google Cloud Platform account
- You are logged-in on the Google Cloud Platform
- You have credentials that can deploy and run applications on Cloud Run (including building them on Cloud Build)
- You've put in your own project ID `scripts/vars.sh`

## Develop and test

There's a basic `build-and-run.sh` script that will build and run the server with Docker. You can also just run `npm run start` in the `src` folder.

## Initialize resources

Set and export variables with `sh scripts/vars.sh`, then run `sh scripts/init.sh`. Uncomment the lower part if you want continuous build etc.

## Deploy server

Run `npm run update:client` which will build and deploy the server to Cloud Run (building it on Cloud Build).

## Deploy client

Run `npm run update:client` which will build and deploy the client to Google Cloud Storage.

## Remove resources

Run `sh scripts/teardown.sh`. Make sure to verify that buckets and registries are empty when the script is finished.
